# Flappy_Bird_AI
Followed a tutorial to build a AI that could play Flappy Bird using NEAT genetic algorithm. With 100 birds per generation a bird that can beat the game almost always spawns. With 20 birds per gen it takes a couple generations. 

The training is first visualized, after a bird can succesfully score 50 points a new game with the successful bird starts where it should be able to play infinitly.
